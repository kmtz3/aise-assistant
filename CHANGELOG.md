# Changelog

All notable changes to aise-assistant are documented here.
Format: `## [version] — YYYY-MM-DD` followed by bullet points grouped by type.

---

## [2.2.5] — 2026-05-09

### Changed
- `notion-schema.md` + `agents/notion-writer.md`: Tasks created after a session must now set `Consumed Package` — inherit from `Source Call` if present, otherwise apply the same date-matching logic as Sessions (active package covering today → most-recently-ended inactive package → leave empty)

---

## [2.2.4] — 2026-05-09

### Fixed
- `session-summarizer` / `project-instructions.md`: Glean `read_document` step now extracts the `id` field from search result objects instead of passing a URL string (which the tool rejects)
- `account-setup`: same `read_document` fix in Step 2 (Gong transcripts) and Guardrails
- `post-session-debrief` Step 12: Customer page update now fetches the page first, checks for template headings before writing, and falls back to appending a `## 📋 Account Notes` section on pages with non-standard templates instead of erroring
- Remove all references to `## 🤝 PB Account Team` — section deleted from the Customer page template; `notion-schema.md` table updated (five → four sections), `account-setup` Step 4A and Step 5 updated accordingly; AE/Renewal Manager info redirected to page properties

---

## [2.2.3] — 2026-05-09

### Fixed
- `notion-sync-owner`: accept `--me` as an alias for `--mine` in Step 2 and Flags section
- `notion-sync-owner`: Customers/Customer relation fields store hyphen-stripped Notion page URLs — LIKE pattern now uses `<customer-url-id>` (hyphens removed), not the bare UUID
- `notion-sync-owner`: drift filter (`Current Account Owner NOT LIKE '%<owner-uuid>%' OR IS NULL`) moved directly into Step 4 WHERE clauses; removed separate Step 5 drift-detection pass to avoid hitting the 500-row LIMIT on already-correct records
- `notion-sync-owner`: Step 1 now documents a fallback to `notion-get-users` with the user's email when `identity.md` is not found, preventing a hard-fail on fresh installs

---

## [2.2.2] — 2026-05-09

### Changed
- Extract identity resolution into a canonical procedure in `context/notion-schema.md` § Identity resolution (three-path chain + graceful stop + `--global` skip rule)
- `notion-flag-renewals` and `notion-sync-owner` Step 1 now reference the shared procedure instead of inlining it

---

## [2.2.1] — 2026-05-09

### Fixed
- `notion-flag-renewals`: identity resolution is now conditional — `--global` skips Step 1 entirely (no file lookup)
- `notion-flag-renewals`: graceful fallback for `--mine` when `.datadir` or `notion_user_id` is missing — surfaces a clear inline message instead of a broken query
- `notion-flag-renewals`: three-path identity resolution (`.datadir` → glob plugin dirs → `notion-get-users` + userEmail)
- `notion-flag-renewals`: date and status filtering pushed into the SQL query — collapses 3 paginated round-trips into 1 targeted fetch
- `notion-flag-renewals`: document known macOS plugin data dir paths directly in the skill

---

## [2.2.0] — 2026-05-09

### Added
- `/notion-sync-owner` skill — push `Customer.Owner` → `Current Account Owner` on all linked Sessions, Tasks, and Active Packages (`--mine` / `--global`)
- `/notion-flag-renewals` skill — set `Status = Renewal` on active packages ending within N days; `--dry-run` previews without writing

---

## [2.1.0] — 2026-05-09

### Added
- Customer page template with agent-readable sections (notion-schema.md)
- Active Package template wired into account-setup and notion-writer agents

### Fixed
- Scope Gong queries to post-sales calls; skip Gmail lookups in delegated (teammate) mode
- Session page structure now driven from Notion templates rather than hard-coded agent logic

---

## [2.0.0] — 2026-05-09

### Added
- `customer-plan-next` agent and `/customer-plan-next` command
- Session page structure driven from Notion templates

### Fixed
- Full plugin review fixes; gitignore `.claude/` from distribution

---

## [1.2.3] — 2026-05-08
